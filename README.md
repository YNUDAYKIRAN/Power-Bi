📊 Power BI – Superstore Sales Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains my **Power BI project** based on the **Superstore dataset (USA market)**.  
The project demonstrates the **end-to-end data analytics workflow** — from **data cleaning and transformation** in Power Query, to **data modeling with DAX**, and finally to **building interactive visualizations and dashboards**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Learn and apply all major **Power BI visualization tools**.  
- Use **Power Query** to clean, transform, and prepare raw data.  
- Create **data models and DAX measures** for meaningful insights.  
- Develop a professional **dashboard** to analyze sales, profit, and customer trends.

## 🔧 Power BI Concepts  

### 🔹 Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)  
- Remove duplicates and null values.  
- Change data types (text, date, numbers).  
- Split and merge columns for clarity.  
- Append and merge queries.  
- Create conditional columns (e.g., Profit Category).  
- Filter and reshape datasets for analysis.  

### 🔹 Data Modeling & DAX  
- Build relationships between **Fact** and **Dimension** tables.  
- Use **Star Schema** for efficient modeling.  
- Create calculated columns & measures:  
  - Total Sales = `SUM(Sales)`  
  - Total Profit = `SUM(Profit)`  
  - Profit Margin = `SUM(Profit) / SUM(Sales)`  
  - YTD / MTD sales performance  
- Define KPIs to track business performance.  

### 🔹 Visualizations in Power BI  
- **Bar & Column Charts** – Sales by category/region.  
- **Line & Area Charts** – Trends over time.  
- **Pie & Donut Charts** – Market share analysis.  
- **Tree Map** – Contribution by sub-category.  
- **Scatter Plot** – Discount vs Profit correlation.  
- **Map Visuals** – Geographic sales distribution.  
- **KPI Cards** – Key metrics (Sales, Profit, Orders).  
- **Tables & Matrix** – Detailed reports with drill-downs.  
- **Slicers & Filters** – Interactive controls for users.
